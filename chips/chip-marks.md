# Chip markings explained

It is well-known that JieLi chips have some completely nonsense markings that
doesn't point out the real chip name (at least, at the first glance).

Althrough they are not the only ones that do that...

- Bluetrum (the 'AB' chips) does that too..
- Buildwin/Appotech is no exception. However they have so many similarities to JieLi that i doubt that's just a coincidence...

But i digress. What's going on?

dunno
