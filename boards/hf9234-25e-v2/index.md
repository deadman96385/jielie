# HF9234-25E-V2

**I don't have this thing anymore because it wasn't mine at all.**
**What i was supposed to do is to replace an microusb port for charging, that's all.**
**But of course i didn't miss an opportunity to do some stuff with it.**
**Of course i also messed with its flash, and of course did dump it to restore it back.**

A board from some blue JBL-ish speaker/boombox.

- MCU: AC6925E
