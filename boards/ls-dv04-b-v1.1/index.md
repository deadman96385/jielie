It has an resolution of **640x480**. Yeah.... That's the 4K quality we want!

...TODO describe all the story...

Or this 480p glory?
Yes it was the 2101th year at that time! I'm a time traveller!
Sadly the BAVASIANOS is gone so now i have the ASYA_CAT instead!..

Or no, it isn't even 2101 (twenty-one-oh-one), it's 2901 (twenty-nine-oh-one)!

And before that there was an "twenty-one-nul-nul" year!
