**JieLi Technology - Chips Delight the World.**

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

JieLi (杰理, "π", "JL", "Jerry" | "jelly", 光) is a company that was based in year 2010 in the ZhuHai city of Guangdong province, China.

Their chips can be found in various cheap MP3 players, Bluetooth speakers, Bluetooth/MP3 modules, dash cams and so on.
(along with some other "competitors" like "Jianrong" (Appotech/Buildwin), "AB" or "A3" Bluetrum, MVSilicon...)

Chips can be identified as JieLi ones by them having a slanted "JL"/"π" logo,
and a misleading/nonsense marking that doesn't tell the real chip name right away,
like "AB1526CG3X1F.1-82E" (AC1082), "AB1819CK1Y11.1-87" (AC1187), "AC1631D97294-04A" (AC5204A), "AC20BP05193-65A4" (AC6965A), to name a few.

Although it seems like they now do print the actual chip names on some recent chip series like JL697N, JL700N, etc.

[There](chips/chip-marks.md) is an attempt to explain what the marking might possibly mean.
