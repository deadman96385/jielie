**JieLi Technology - Chips Delight the World.**

Yes Indeed!
Most cheap Bluetooth speakers, Bluetooth audio modules, MP3 players, etc. are based on their chips!
Or maybe some other companies like *Appotech* or *Beken* or *Actions SEMI* or *RDA*... or *bluetrum*????

Appotech and JieLi are very similar..... Isn't it because they are both based in ZhuHai??
